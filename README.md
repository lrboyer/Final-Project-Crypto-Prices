# Tracecamp CRA Template

A minimal configuration for Create React App that includes Tailwind and Axios pre-configured.

## Setup

### `npm install`

## Developing

### `npm run start`

## Deploying to Surge

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the site and then runs surge inside of that folder. If you want to specify a domain for surge (if you've already deployed), you can run the surge command manually within the `build` folder that is generated like so `npx surge --domain {your-subdomain}.surge.sh`
